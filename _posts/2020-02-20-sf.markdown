This year, we will focus on brain tracts (diffusion tensor imaging) & deep learning.
The two talks, DTI (by UCSF Dep. Neurology's expert Dr. Mandelli) and Deep Learning (by UCSF Dep. Radiology's expert Dr. Pedoia), will be live-streamed as well
(DTI: [https://ucsf.zoom.us/j/685277366](https://ucsf.zoom.us/j/685277366); Deep Learning: [https://ucsf.zoom.us/j/288710093](https://ucsf.zoom.us/j/288710093)).
