## Summary

*Photo by Tiffany von Armin*

This 5 day hands-on workshop, held at the University of Washington eScience Institute in Seattle, will focus on technologies used to analyze human neuroscience data, on methods used to extract information from large datasets of publicly available data (such as the International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative, Human Connectome Project, OpenfMRI, etc.), and on tools for making human neuroscience research open and reproducible.

Morning sessions will be devoted to lectures and tutorials, and afternoon sessions will be devoted to participant-directed activities: guided work on team projects, hackathon sessions, and breakout sessions on topics of interest.

For more details, see [http://neurohackweek.github.io/](http://neurohackweek.github.io/)

We are now accepting applications from trainees and researchers in different stages of their career (graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and research staff) to participate at: [https://form.jotformeu.com/70342294106348](https://form.jotformeu.com/70342294106348)

Some experience in human neuroscience and at least basic knowledge in programming is desired, but we welcome applications from participants with a variety of relevant backgrounds.

Accepted applicants will be asked to pay a fee of $200 upon final registration. This fee will include participation in the course, accommodation in the UW dorms, and two meals a day (breakfast and lunch), for the duration of the course. A limited number of fee waivers and travel grants will be available. We encourage students with financial need and students from groups that are underrepresented in neuroimaging and data science to apply for these grants (see application form for details).

Important dates:

- April 18th: Deadline for applications to participate
- May 6th: Notification of acceptance
- June 1st: Final registration deadline

On behalf of the instructors,

Ariel Rokem, UW eScience \\
Tal Yarkoni, UT Austin
