Description: At the OHBM Brainhack, members of the community gather to work collaboratively on common projects.
The event also features a TrainTrack in which tutorials on open science practices are provided.

Brainhacks differ from typical academic conference in that attendees can actively take part in the 
program and co-learn from each other. Thus, they will be actively trying to create something rather
than passively attend. Although many brainhack projects might involve coding, it is not a 
requirement and many projects can be done without coding skills.
