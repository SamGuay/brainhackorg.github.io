## Summary
CirrusScience (Cloud Infrastructure for Reproducible Research and Utilities for Sharing Science) is a platform as a service effort to bring together interoperable services. Over the period of the hackathon, we will coordinate that web-service projects start adopting standard API strategies and metadata representation methods for communicating with each other. Another key component of this infrastructure is to use tools such as docker and vagrant to make peer to peer computing services available. We will implement such peer to peer clients for a few use cases in brain imaging.
