The weeklong workshop to be held held Aug 19-23 has three main objectives -- sharing the theory and intuition behind a myriad of powerful methods we have developed over the past ten years, showcasing the applicability of these methods on relevant problems and datasets, and helping our collaborators and community use these methods for their own work. Each day we will focus on a cohesive collection of tools with the three main objectives in mind. For more information visit [https://neurodata.devpost.com/](https://neurodata.devpost.com/)
