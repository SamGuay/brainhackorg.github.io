## Brainhack Global Geneva 2019  

Location: Campus Biotech, Geneva, Switzerland  
Website: [www.brainhack.ch](https://brainhack.ch)  

Come and join our 2-day Â½ Brainhack on November Friday 8th / Saturday 9th with a pre-event on Thursday 7th late afternoon for project pitches and drinks! While all projects will deal with the brain, quite a few will explore beyond imaging, with projects mixing imaging with augmented reality, brain stimulation and brain-computer interfaces. Everyone is welcome, whatever their background. For more information, and to join us, check out our website at www.brainhack.ch
