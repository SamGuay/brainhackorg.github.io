The Montreal BrainHack School is a 4-weeks long full-time educational workshop, which will train participants in a range of fundamental tools for neuronal data science, applied at the interface of Neuroscience, Statistical modelling and Computer Science, using a project-based, multidisciplinary approach. The school is an initiative of the group for the union of neuroscience and artificial intelligence in Québec (UNIQUE), and features instructors from four institutions: McGill, Université de Montréal, École Polytechnique and Concordia University.

Graduate students at École Polytechnique, Concordia University and McGill University can register to PSY 6983 through the Bureau de coopération inter-universitaire. Participants from outside of the partner institutions can register too.
