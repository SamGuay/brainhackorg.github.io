## Summary
The goal of the Alzheimer’s Disease Big Data DREAM8.5 Challenge 1 (AD#1) is to apply an open science approach to rapidly identify accurate predictive AD biomarkers that can be used by the scientific, industrial, and regulatory communities to improve AD diagnosis and treatment. AD#1 will be the first in a series of Alzheimer’s Big Data Challenges to leverage genetics and brain imaging data in combination with cognitive assessments, biomarkers and demographic information from cohorts ranging from cognitively normal to mild cognitively impaired to individuals with Alzheimer’s disease.
