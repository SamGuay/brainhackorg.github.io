#Dockerize Neurosynth
##Summary
Getting a development environment for Neurosynth up and running is a pain at the moment (seehttp://github.com/neurosynth/neurosynth). In this project, weâ€™ll wrap the server code and all dependencies up in a nice Docker container so that contributing to Neurosynth becomes much easier.
