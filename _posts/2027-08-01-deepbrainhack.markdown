### Location
[Notman House, 51 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, Quebec](https://www.google.com/maps?ll=45.511928,-73.570065&z=16&t=m&hl=en-US&gl=CA&mapclient=embed&cid=11433532947443404990)

### Summary
The goals of this two-day hacking sprint are to familiarize the deep learning community with specific challenges faced working with medical data, and to introduce neuroscience researchers to the opportunities presented by new deep learning architectures for scientific discovery.

Brainhack has always been a collaborative event that focuses on open sharing of ideas, code, and even data. The AI community is at the forefront of open science, where most authors pre-print open access papers and publish their code so that others can easily reproduce their work and adapt it to their own use case.
