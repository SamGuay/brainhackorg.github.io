## Summary:
The ADHD-200 Sample is a grassroots initiative, dedicated to accelerating the scientific community’s understanding of the neural basis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) through the implementation of open data-sharing and discovery-based science. Towards this goal, the ADHD-200 consortium has publicly released 776 resting-state fMRI and anatomical datasets aggregated across 8 independent imaging sites, 491 of which were obtained from typically developing individuals and 285 in children and adolescents with ADHD (ages: 7-21 years old). Accompanying phenotypic information includes: diagnostic status, dimensional ADHD symptom measures, age, sex, intelligence quotient (IQ) and lifetime medication status. More information on the [ADHD-200 website](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/).

## What can I do?  
You can contribute datasets to the study. It is also possible to process either parts of the database or the full database and share the results publicly, see the [ADHD-200 prepocessed!](http://brainhack.org/2012/01/05/adhd200-preprocessed/) project

## How can I join?
