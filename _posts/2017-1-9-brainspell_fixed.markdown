## Summary
More than 1 neuroimaging paper is published every hour. But we can keep up with the literature if we do it all together!

[BrainSpell](http://brainspell.org/) is a web portal where we can annotate the papers extracted by NeuroSynth (>9,000!) using ontologies from CognitiveAtlas and BrainMap.

Your task will be to read the full text, tell us if you agree or not with the tags already entered, give us information about the stereotaxic space used by the article, and an approximation of the number of subjects in the study.

Let’s annotate the 1st 10% of papers in BrainSpell – less than 4 papers per day per brainhack participant!

All the code and the content in BrainSpell is open under a Creativity Commons license and Open Source.

## What to do:
Your task will be to pick papers to tag (there’s either a random list of papers, you can search papers from your field, or tag your own papers), read the full text, tell us if you agree or not with the tags already entered, give us information about the stereotaxic space used by the article, and an approximation of the number of subjects in the study. If you are into web programming, the BrainSpell client runs on javascript, jQuery, WebGL, the server runs on mySQL and PHP, and there are plenty of things to do!

## How to join:
For the enthusiast, you can start tagging already! Go to [http://brainspell.org](http://brainspell.org) open an account, and go for it. More information about BrainSpell can be found in our blog. If you have any ideas, you can contact Roberto Toro by e-mail [rto@pasteur.fr](mailto: rto@pasteur.fr).
