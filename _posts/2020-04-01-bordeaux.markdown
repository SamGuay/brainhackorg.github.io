Description: Brainhack Bordeaux will be promoting the interaction between scientists,
developers, and artists interested in the brain. Questions can evolve around the 
investigation of brain anatomy and function based on non-invasive imaging methods (e.g. MRI, nTMS) 
and intraoperative brain mapping methods, or post mortem dissection the evolution of nervous systems 
across species the variability of brain features across healthy participants the insurgence of 
brain pathologies and there is no limit to artistic reflections in any form of art.

The event was initially scheduled for April, 1-3, but it has been postponed. The
new date will be announced as soon as possible.
