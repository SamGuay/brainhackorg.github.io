## Summary:
With the emergence of large fMRI databases, there is a need for tools for high-throughput quality control. Although a few tools (such as [mit-art](http://code.google.com/p/mit-art/)) exist to detect outliers in fMRI databases, most standard packages propose no solution besides the visual inspection of individual results. This project is to build a work group with the following objectives:  
1. Document existing strategies implemented in a variety of labs.  
2. Compare the outcomes of these strategies on public databases such as the 1000 functional connectomes.  
3. Brainstorm for novel approaches.  

## What can I do?  
There are at this stage two ways to contribute. First, if you are developing/using a package which includes some tools to screen large or small fMRI databases for quality control, you can share a few slides that summarize your strategy. Second, if you used such an approach on a large public database such as ADHD200 or the 1000 functional connectome, please prepare a summary of the outcome, such as the one that was generated for the NIAK release of the [preprocessed ADHD200 database](http://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/neurobureau:NIAKPipeline#Quality_control_of_the_preprocessing_-_Training_dataset).
