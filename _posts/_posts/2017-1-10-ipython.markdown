## Summary
This project will build on a starting set of [IPython](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) notebooks to replace [BIPS](https://github.com/INCF/BrainImagingPipelines) as a environment for scalable, reproducible analysis and interactive exploration of data. The project will also ensure easy interoperability with data submission sites such as [Neurovault](http://brainhack.org/neurovault-org-ni-dm/) and synthesis platforms such as [Neurosynth](http://brainhack.org/neurosynth-org/).
