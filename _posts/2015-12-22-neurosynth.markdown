NeuroSynth is a platform for large-scale, automated synthesis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data extracted from published articles.

## What can I do?  
Currently you can download most of the images on the website by clicking on the ‘Download image’ link under the corresponding image. In the near future, you’ll also be able to download coordinate and study lists. Data dumps of the full coordinate database and various image datasets will also be made available shortly.  

All data available on this site are released under an [Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL)](http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/). This means that while the data are free to use and adapt however you wish, there are some restrictions you need to abide by. Namely, you must (a) attribute any public use of the database, (b) publicly share (under a same or compatible license) any derivate or adapted works, and (c) distribute an open version of any derivative works. For more information on the license, see the [human-readable summary](http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/) or the [full legalese](http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/).  

The NeuroSynth framework is built on several interrelated packages, most of which are available in our [github repository](http://github.com/neurosynth). There’s also some rudimentary documentation, which I’ll add to as time allows. Contributions to the codebase are very welcome.

## How can I join?
One of our main goals in developing NeuroSynth is to promote open, synthesis-oriented approaches to the analysis of neuroimaging data. We think open science is the best kind of science, and are gradually making most of our software, data, and results publicly available to that end. If you have any comments, suggestions, bug reports, or questions, please email [Tal Yarkoni](mailto: tal.yarkoni@colorado.edu).

## Who are the members?
The NeuroSynth framework is a collaborative effort between Tal Yarkoni, Tor Wager, Tom Nichols, Russ Poldrack, and David Van Essen. The website, and most of the underlying analysis tools, were developed by Tal Yarkoni. Lots of other people have contributed valuable feedback and testing, including Alex Shackman, Drew Fox, Luke Chang, Tim Vickery, Jessica Andrews-Hanna, and members of the Neuroimaging Data Access Group.
