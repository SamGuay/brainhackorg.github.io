## Summary: MRI data quality control over a wide range of acquisition parameters
The overarching goal of CoRR is to create an open science resource for the imaging community that will facilitate the assessment of test-retest reliability and reproducibility for functional and structural connectomics. In order to accomplish this, we will aggregate resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) and diffusion imaging data across laboratories around the world, and share the data via the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project / International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative (FCP/INDI) to enable the:
1) Establishment of test-retest reliability and reproducibility for commonly used MR-based connectome metrics 2) Determination of the range of variation in the reliability and reproducibility of these metrics across imaging sites and retest study designs 3) Creation of a standard/benchmark test-retest dataset for the evaluation of novel metrics
Currently, we have pledges for test-retest data from more than 1300 participants around the world, and are planning a release in spring, 2014.

## What can I do?  
The CoRR team is readying to develop a template data paper for each of the individual contributing sites for CoRR to submit to a special issue. Our hope is that the template will be useful for other data sharing initiatives more broadly. Data papers promise to be a vital tool in data sharing â€“ both for ensuring transparency regarding data collection methods, and ensuring proper academic crediting. To learn more about the importance of data papers, please see [http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fnins.2013.00009/abstract](http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fnins.2013.00009/abstract)
We will be working on the template at the BrainHack and would love your input.
