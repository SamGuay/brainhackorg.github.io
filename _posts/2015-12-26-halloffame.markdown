description: The OpenMind project aims to create easy-to-use high-quality open source EEG boards which may e.g. be used in conjunction with an Arduino to build a OpenSource EEG. We use integrated analog frontends with 24 bit precision for data acquisition.

Quite often when I advocate for data sharing I am missing good examples of scientific work that would not be possible or would be much more expensive if data would not be shared. Therefore I thought it would beneficial for our cause to have a little database of papers that are using publicly available data. I have quickly put together a webapp to do this. You can find it here:  
[http://neurodatafame.appspot.com/](http://neurodatafame.appspot.com/)  
The website is far from finished and requires quite bit of testing. Among things that need to be added are:  
– support for pmid  
– automatic import of existing lists such as [http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/publications/](http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/publications/)  
– adding a pretty design
The code lives at [https://github.com/chrisfilo/neurodatafame](https://github.com/chrisfilo/neurodatafame)  
Any PRs would be greatly appreciated!
