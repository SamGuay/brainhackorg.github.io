## Summary

FMRIPREP is a robust fMRI preprocessing tool that aims at providing the best results possible independently of the origin of the input data (see [http://fmriprep.readthedocs.io](http://fmriprep.readthedocs.io) for more details). The tool is under active development. There are a few small, self-contained, yet interesting features/issues that could potentially be picked up by Brainhack Global participants. We have listed them on [https://github.com/poldracklab/fmriprep/labels/potential%20hackathon%20project](https://github.com/poldracklab/fmriprep/labels/potential%20hackathon%20project) - get in touch if you would like to work on any of those mini projects!
